# LED-counter-on-Spartan-6

This project implements a counter that uses LEDs to show the count value. 
The count values are displayed in 8-bit binary as my board has only 8 LEDs.

The project has been implemented on the Mimas V2 Spartan 6 FPGA Dev Board.

Request you to alter clock scaler according to your clock speed.
